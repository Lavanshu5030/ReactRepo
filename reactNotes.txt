React
-it is library which is use to create rich UI.
-it work on component
-it is a library, not a framework


To learn react you must be avare about
-html
-css
-js 

*s/w pre requesites
-nodejs
-text editor

*there are two ways to create react project
1. By using npx(if you are using npx then no need to install configuration file)
    step 1: npx create-react-app project name
    step 2:cd projectname
    step 3: npm start

Q. What is npx?
npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) 

2. By using npm(need to install first configuration file)
    step 1:npm install create-react-app
    step 2:create-react-app-projectName
    step 3:cd projectName
    step 4: npm start


Q. What is the difference between React and Angular
    -React is a library and Angular is framework 
    -In react we can perform one way data binding
    -In Angular we can perform two way data binding
    -React is faster than Angular
    -Angular is little bit slower than react
    -In react we use javascript and XML
    -In Angular we use typescript and HTML 
    -React is designed and developed by facebook
    -Angular is designed and developed by google
    -React introduced in 2013
    -Angular is introduced in 2009

Q. What is babel in react
-In react babel is transpiler which convert modern javascript code into a core
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest ECMAScript (ES) 
features and syntax in your JavaScript code, even if the environments in which 
you run your code do not yet support those features. It is a tool commonly used
in React projects to transpile modern JavaScript code into a format that is 
compatible with older browsers or environments.

Q. What is SPA
- SPA is a single page application
-In this only .html page will display on browser and remaning are it component


Q. What is component in react
- It is the partial part of our web application
- It can be reuse multiple time
- It can be anypart like header, footer, section,nav...
- In react app.js is root component
- App.js is a default component



In react we have two types of component
1.Function component: When your main focus on UI Design in that case we use Function component
2.Class component: When we have to write complex logical code in that case we use Class component

-What is the purpose of node_modules folder
node_modules folder
    *All the third party library and dependency will get install in node_modules folder

package.json file
-What ever the third party library and dependency we install in our project its entry will be available in package.json file

README.md file
-it provide the log or information regarding our project how to use it
-All information about react project

.gitignore file
-it ignores unnecessary file to upload on github or in production mode 


-While creating component always start with upper case 

-How to display individual component
-To display individual component we have to write component name as a tag where you want

Q. Create a Function component of name MyFcComp and display its output?

Q.What is javascriptXML(JSX)?
    -It allows us to use html code in react
    -It makes react code easy
    -In JSX we have parent to wrap another element in it, parent can be any block element

XML is strict language compare to HTML

-What is props?
    -It is a parameter or Function parameter which is used to pass data inside component
    -It return object type of data
    -This Function component we can access props by props.propsName 
    -In Class component we can access props by this.props.propsName

-use of props in function component
    import React from 'react';

    // Function component with props
    const MyComponent = (props) => {
    // You can use props here to access the data passed from the parent component
    return (
        <div>
        <p>{props.message}</p>
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default MyComponent;

-use in class component

    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    // Class component with props
    class MyComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <div>
            <p>{this.props.message}</p>
        </div>
        );
    }
    }

    export default MyComponent;  


Create a class of parameter(fname,lname,contact,gender,age)
and access it by using props        

-Destructor of props    

-What is State in react?
    -State in react is used to handle essential data in class component
    -State only available in a class component
    -We write state in class component constructor
    -State return us data in object format
    -We can access state data outside state...by writing this.state.propertyName

Create MyStateComp class component

-setState() method
-It is use to update state data
-How to do Destructor state

-Function and events in react
-HoverComp


Q. Create one class component of name UpdateStateComp and display its output on browser
-create a state...inside there is property of name count 
-display this output  


-Create CondRenderComp class
-Rendering meand displaying data on browser
-Conditional Rendering: displaying Component output or view Conditionaly
    1. if else
    2. element as variable: In this we store data in variable and return that variable
    3. Use of ternary operator: It is short hand syntax for if else.
        syntax:(condition) ? truepart : falsePart;
    4. Short circuit: If condition is true then only it will display component output
    syntax: (condition) && <h2>Admin Login Successfully </h2>;

-How to display images,multimedia
-How to access data from constant file

-How to use css
1. Internal css
2. External css:In this we create a separate css file and import it  component
3. Module css: if you want to write css property for a particular component in that case we use it
    -it will work only when you import it
    -file must save with filename.module.css

-Component Interaction
    -Accessing data from one component to another component
    -To access from one component for that they must have parent Child relation, to make parent child 
    relation, to make parent child relation in between for that  we write child component name as 
    tag in parent component.

We have seen
-How to pass state as a props
-How to method as props 

Create a function component of name MyCSSComp


                Create MyImagesComp function component

                Q. make a file, import all the images 

                Create class MyPureComp component 
                Steps 1: create a file of name MyPureComp.js 
                Step 2: create class MyPureComp which extends Component

                -ParaentComp (class)
                -ChildComp (function) 

-PureComponent
    -It prevents unnecessary re-Rendering of class component
    -It perform shallow comparison
    -To achieve this we have to extends class with PureComponent class.


To use function in another file
React.memo() method
    -It prevents unnecessary re-Rendering of function component.
    -It perform shallow comparison
    -To achieve this we have to React.memo() method


Q.How to use Bootstrap in React app?

create HoverCounterComp(Class component)
create ClickCounterComp(Class component)

-You have a state in both the class with property state => count:0


imp 
HOC Higher Order Component
When we have a same business login and want to share with multiple component
-In HOC we share logic from function component to another component
-

Use of react snipet for create class and function component

rce => it will create class component
rconst => it will generate constructor with super method and with state
rfce => it will generate function component
rafce => it will generate function component with arrow function.

*render props :
-When we have same business logic and want to share with multiple component
-In this we share logic from class component to another class and function component.

-It is an alternative for JSX.
-Which remove unwanted element from react project

How to render list by using array data
instead of using modern dom directly 
where it does all the neccessary manupulation changes with the virtual dom before making on real dom

-ErrorBoundary
-It is a component in react which use to handle errors in component
-In this we use two component lifecycle method
1. getDerivedStateFormError :It is the static method which invoke when error occure in component
                             and it return state state value 
2. componentDidcatch :it display error log(information)

Q. Create a component function component?
of name UserComp

-Component lifecycle method 
-Class component has lifecycle method
-It comes with four phases
1.Mounting:
            -constructor: it invoke automatically when component initialize.
            -getDerivedStateFormPromps:it is a static method which is use to assign data comming from
                                       props to state
            -render: It is used to display component data or information on browser

            -componentDidcatch:It will execute once after render method

2.Update phases, it gives us boolean value
            -shouldcomponentUpdate:It is use to decide weather component should update or not

            -getSnapshotBeforUpdate:it hold previous data or information of state and props 
            -render
            -componentWillupdate:
3. Unmounting phase:
            -ComponentWillUnmount:It will execute just before deleting an component
4.Error Phase:
            -getDerivedStateFromError:
            -componentDidcatch.   

Routing in react:
-Navigation on component to display data
-In this we create Routing path for component and we write path name in browser url to display
component view or output.

-To perform Routing in react first we have to install using :react-router-dom library
install by using:npm i react-router-dom

-In react-router-dom library it contain BrowserRouter, Routes and Route library which 
is use to perform Routing.

-In Routing BrowserRouter must be parent element for all routing, means all routing
should under BrowserRouter.

-Route is used to create a path

-There are multiple types of Routing
1. Naming Routing: By Writing path name in browser url to display component output

2. default Routing: display component view by default means without writing path name
                    in browser, in this pathname must be blank

3. Parameterized Routing:In this we have to pass parameter with pathname in browser
                         url

4. Child Routing:

5. WildCard Routing: display component output when you write wrong pathname in browser url,
                    for this we have to * in path name

Note Imp point:WildCard routing always define at last otherwise other routings won't work

Q. Creating WildCard routing
1.  PageNotFound.js filename
2. Create function of name PageNotFound()
3. Write <Route path = '/*' element={<PageNotFound />}></Route>

Q. Create a function component of name MyRoutingComp( function)

Q. Create a footerComp function component having div with class 'text-primary' 
and write This app is designed and developed by Lavanshu Deshmukh and copywrite symbol

Q. Create a ReactHookComp function component 
  2. Create UseStateHookComp (function)
  3. Create UseEffectHookComp (function)

-React Hooks
    -Hooks in react function component provide class component features and allows to use 
    state in function component
    -In react hooks introduce in react version 16



Rules for hooks:
    Hooks works with function component only
    Hooks can not be render Conditionaly.
    hooks always use in top level component.

-useState hook:
    -it allows us to use state in function component.
    -It gives us two value in array 
    1. is current-state and
    2. function to update state
    3. To use useState hook first we have to import from react library
-in useState hook we can pass number, string, boolean, array and object type of data 


-UseEffect Hook
    -It is used to perform side effect or action in function component.
    -side effect means fetching data from server, Dom manupulation and event handling.
    -UseEffect hooks takes two parameter
    1. callback function
    2. Array or dependency
    -UseEffect hooks execute after render method

-How to create REST fake API
step 1: install json-server search on npm
using comand:npm install -g json-server 

Step 2: Create database folder inside shared folder

    ]
}
Run this command to start server
json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json

*Concurrently:
search Concurrently on npm's website
step1:
install by using:npm i -g concurrently
step 2:
go to package.json file write command
        "json-server":"cd src/shared/database && json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json",
        "start-dev":"concurrently \"npm start\" \"npm run json-server\"",

Step 3: Stop all server and write one command in project path
npm run start-dev

Web-Storage
-It is use to store user data on browser
-there is are two types
1:local Storage: It is used to store user data permanently
    localStorage.setItem("user1", "sammed"); to set user on localStorage
    localStorage.setItem("user2","Vishwas"); 
    localStorage.getItem("user1"): to get the data
    localStorage.removeItem("user3"); to remove a specific data
    localStorage.clear(); to clear all the data


2:Session Storage: It is used to store user data for limited time
  sessionStorage.setItem("user1", "sammed"); to set user on localStorage
    sessionStorage.setItem("user2","Vishwas"); 
    sessionStorage.getItem("user1"): to get the data
    sessionStorage.removeItem("user3"); to remove a specific data
    sessionStorage.clear(); to clear all the data


"users":[
    {"id":1, "userid":"admin","userpass":"admin@123"},

-Material UI
How to install Material UI using command
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

-To use Material UI concepts
npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react

-useRef hooks
-It allows to access down the node directly as well as its


-What is redux?
    -redux is not tied to react
    -can be used with React, Angular,Vue or even vanilla javascript
    -redux is a state container
        -redux stores the state of your application
        
-redux is predictable state constainer application for javascript apps
-redux can change the state of the application

React + redux
Why would we want to use redux?
-Component in react have their own state

React Works on 3, 4 concepts
1. store
2. Reducer
3. action
-It stores or hold the state of javascript application

1.Store -It store discription of your operation...which you are going to perform
2.action-It is the plane javascript object which are type property which store string constant value
3.Reducer: it perfom state transition depending on action and store

-What is redux?
-What is store?
-What is action?
-What is Reducer?

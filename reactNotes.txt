*there are two ways to create react project
1. By using npx(if you are using npx then no need to install configuration file)
    step 1: npx create-react-app project name
    step 2:cd projectname
    step 3: npm start

Q. What is npx?
npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) 

2. By using npm(need to install first configuration file)
    step 1:npm install create-react-app
    step 2:create-react-app-projectName
    step 3:cd projectName
    step 4: npm start


Q. What is the difference between React and Angular

    -In react we can perform one way data binding
    -In Angular we can perform two way data binding
    -React is faster than Angular
    -Angular is little bit slower than react
    -In react we use javascript and XML
    -In Angular we use typescript and HTML

Q. What is babel in react
-In react babel is transpiler which convert modern javascript code into a core
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest ECMAScript (ES) 
features and syntax in your JavaScript code, even if the environments in which 
you run your code do not yet support those features. It is a tool commonly used
in React projects to transpile modern JavaScript code into a format that is 
compatible with older browsers or environments.

Q. What is SPA
- SPA is a single page application
-In this only .html page will display on browser and remaning are it component


Q. What is component in react
- It is the partial part of our web application
- It can be reuse multiple time
- It can be anypart like header, footer, section,nav...
- In react app.js is root component
- App.js is a default component



In react we have two types of component
1.Function component: When your main focus on UI Design in that case we use Function component
2.Class component: When we have to write complex logical code in that case we use Class component

-What is the purpose of node_modules folder
node_modules folder
    *All the third party library and dependency will get install in node_modules folder

package.json file
-What ever the third party library and dependency we install in our project its entry will be available in package.json file

README.md file
-it provide the log or information regarding our project how to use it
-All information about react project

.gitignore file
-it ignores unnecessary file to upload on github or in production mode 


-While creating component always start with upper case 

-How to display individual component
-To display individual component we have to write component name as a tag where you want

Q. Create a Function component of name MyFcComp and display its output?

Q.What is javascriptXML(JSX)?
    -It allows us to use html code in react
    -It makes react code easy
    -In JSX we have parent to wrap another element in it, parent can be any block element

XML is strict language compare to HTML

-What is props?
    -It is a parameter or Function parameter which is used to pass data inside component
    -It return object type of data
    -This Function component we can access props by props.propsName 
    -In Class component we can access props by this.props.propsName

-use of props in function component
    import React from 'react';

    // Function component with props
    const MyComponent = (props) => {
    // You can use props here to access the data passed from the parent component
    return (
        <div>
        <p>{props.message}</p>
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default MyComponent;

-use in class component

    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    // Class component with props
    class MyComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
        <div>
            <p>{this.props.message}</p>
        </div>
        );
    }
    }

    export default MyComponent;  


Create a class of parameter(fname,lname,contact,gender,age)
and access it by using props        

-Destructor of props    

-What is State in react?
    -State in react is used to handle essential data in class component
    -State only available in a class component
    -We write state in class component constructor
    -State return us data in object format
    -We can access state data outside state...by writing this.state.propertyName

Create MyStateComp class component

-setState
-It is use to update state data
-How to do Destructor state

-Function and events in react
-HoverComp


Q. Create one class component of name UpdateStateComp and display its output on browser
-create a state...inside there is property of name count 
-display this output  


-Create CondRenderComp class
-Rendering meand displaying data on browser
-Conditional Rendering: displaying Component output or view Conditionaly
    1. if else
    2. element as variable: In this we store data in variable and return that variable
    3. Use of ternary operator: It is short hand syntax for if else.
        syntax:(condition) ? truepart : falsePart;
    4. Short circuit: If condition is true then only it will display component output
    syntax: (condition) && <h2>Admin Login Successfully </h2>;

-How to display images,multimedia
-How to access data from constant file

-How to use css
1. Internal css
2. External css:In this we create a separate css file and import it  component
3. Module css: if you want to write css property for a particular component in that case we use it
    -it will work only when you import it
    -file must save with filename.module.css

-Component Interaction
    -Accessing data from one component to another component
    -To access from one component for that they must have parent Child relation, to make parent child 
    relation, to make parent child relation in between for that  we write child component name as 
    tag in parent component.

We have seen
-How to pass state as a props
-How to method as props 

Create a function component of name MyCSSComp


                Create MyImagesComp function component

                Q. make a file, import all the images 

                Create class MyPureComp component 
                Steps 1: create a file of name MyPureComp.js 
                Step 2: create class MyPureComp which extends Component

                -ParaentComp (class)
                -ChildComp (function) 

-PureComponent
    -It prevents unnecessary re-Rendering of class component
    -It perform shallow comparison
    -To achieve this we have to extends class with PureComponent class.


To use function in another file
React.memo() method
    -It prevents unnecessary re-Rendering of function component.
    -It perform shallow comparison
    -To achieve this we have to React.memo() method
